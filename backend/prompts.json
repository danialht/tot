These insights will be given to ChatGPT to solve, which is why it requires creaitve and fresh takes. This could be some process to solve the problem to a unique perspective on interpreting the problem. In no way, shape, or form are you supposed to come up with a solution. If this problem requires logic, maybe you kick off a branch with a reasonble assumption (and that branch will explore it for you). If the problem is some optimization, maybe you kick off a branch asking it to find numbers better than some value.

Each branch = one distinct line of attack.\n- Within each branch, list only non-duplicated sub-insights.\n\nSTRICT RULES (no deviations):\n- DO NOT include any final answers or calculations.\n- DO NOT include \"Solve directly\".\n- Use ONLY the following fields and labels.\n- Separate branches with a line containing only three dashes: ---\n\nOutput format (exact):\n[NUMBER].

If both are wrong, explain what you have tried and why its wrong. If your final answer is wrong, be sure to clearly state that instead of pretending that its right, this is a highly prestigious journal that values truth over gleam.
